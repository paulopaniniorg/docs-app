## Backstage

Backstage is a tool that is used to host all things related to technical documentation and it also has some other cool features like being able to create a new repository based on a template.  
We're gonna create our repositories with that new feature.  
You can read more about what backstage can do here: [What is backstage?](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage)
